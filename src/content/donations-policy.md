# Donations Policy Statement
## Together for Treaty Campaign
**Effective July 2025**  
**Issued by Common Threads, in partnership with the Centre for Australian Progress**

## Purpose

This policy outlines how donations to the Together for Treaty campaign are managed and how we protect donor information. It is intended to provide transparency and clarity to supporters of the campaign.

## Partnership and Tax Deductibility

Common Threads is a First Nations-led organisation. As we establish independent fundraising systems, donations to the Together for Treaty campaign are currently accepted in partnership with the Centre for Australian Progress, a registered charity with Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status.

All donations over $2 are tax-deductible.

## Privacy and Data Use

When you donate to the campaign, your contact details are shared with the Centre for Australian Progress only for the purpose of issuing receipts and communicating with you about your donation. Your data will not be sold or used for unrelated purposes.

## Looking Ahead

Common Threads is in the process of establishing independent systems for donation processing and data management. Once in place, we will transition to managing donations and donor communications directly.
