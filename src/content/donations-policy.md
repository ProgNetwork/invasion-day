# Donations Policy Statement
## Invasion Day Campaign
**Effective July 2025**  
**Issued by Common Threads Indigenous Peoples Organisation Ltd**

## Purpose

This policy outlines how donations to the Invasion Day campaign are managed and how we protect donor information. It is intended to provide transparency and clarity to supporters of the campaign.

## Partnership and Tax Deductibility

Your contribution helps support First Nations organisers, community events, and storytelling. This campaign is being coordinated by Common Threads Indigenous Peoples Organisation Ltd. Donations over $2 are tax deductible. Your tax receipt will be issued by the Common Threads Indigenous Peoples Organisation Ltd.

## Privacy and Data Use

When you donate to the campaign, your contact details are shared with the Common Threads Indigenous Peoples Organisation Ltd only for the purpose of issuing receipts and communicating with you about your donation. Your data will not be sold or used for unrelated purposes.

## Looking Ahead

Common Threads is in the process of establishing independent systems for donation processing and data management. Once in place, we will transition to managing donations and donor communications directly.
