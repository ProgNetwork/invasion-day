# Donations Policy Statement
## Together for Treaty Campaign
**Effective July 2025**  
**Issued by Common Threads in partnership with Centre for Australian Progress**

## Purpose

This Donations Policy outlines how small-dollar online contributions to the Together for Treaty campaign will be processed, managed, and used in line with the values and obligations of Common Threads and the Centre for Australian Progress.

## Overview

The Together for Treaty campaign is coordinated by Common Threads, a First Nations-led organisation working to build Indigenous power and drive systemic change. The campaign microsite provides a central space for supporters to access resources, sign petitions, attend events, and make financial contributions.

All donations over $2 are tax-deductible and are processed via Stripe into the Centre for Australian Progress (CAP) DGR bank account, under an interim arrangement until Common Threads establishes its own independent financial and fundraising systems.

## Donation Processing and Receipting

Donations are processed using a Stripe account managed by Common Threads.

Funds are paid into the CAP DGR bank account.

The Centre for Australian Progress is responsible for:

* Issuing tax receipts to all donors.
* Ensuring compliance with DGR obligations and Australian tax law.

## Use of Funds

Funds raised through the Together for Treaty campaign are used exclusively for activities aligned with:

* The charitable purpose of the Centre for Australian Progress
* The stated aims of the Together for Treaty campaign
* The scope of work of Common Threads

Approved uses include:

* Staff costs relating to campaign coordination and delivery
* Travel and logistical expenses directly associated with the campaign
* Creative work, including design and storytelling assets
* Community outreach, events, and trainings to advance Treaty awareness and First Nations justice

## Review and Accountability

Alex Hill will conduct a monthly reconciliation of Stripe income attributed to the campaign.

A financial report will be provided monthly to CAP leadership and to Claire for monitoring and compliance.

## Transition to Independent Systems

Common Threads is in the process of establishing its own DGR-eligible financial infrastructure. When this is complete:

* The campaign Stripe account and donor database will be migrated to Common Threads.
* Website donation pathways will be updated to direct funds to Common Threads' own accounts.
* Donor communications and receipting will be managed independently.
