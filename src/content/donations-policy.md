## Small Dollar Online Fundraising Proposal: Together for Treaty Campaign

### Summary

Common Threads is launching a Together for Treaty campaign microsite, as a hub for supporters to learn more about our Treaty campaign and take action - including resources, events, petitions and a form to accept small-dollar donations.

We propose that these donations are processed through a new Stripe account, managed by Common Threads, with payouts into the Centre for Australian Progress DGR bank account - until such time as Common Threads has a standalone account of our own. Donor data will be shared with Australian Progress to ensure donors are issued receipts and can make contact if needed regarding their donations.

### How will the funds be used?

Funds raised through the Australian Progress DGR account will be utilised towards agreed activities in line with Australian Progress's charitable purpose, donor expectations, and the agreed scope of work of Common Threads - namely:

- Staff capacity going towards the Treaty campaign - e.g. Alex and Tarneen's time
- Common Threads travel and logistical expenses relating to the Treaty campaign
- Creative capacity and assets to tell the story of the campaign
- Community events and trainings to build public understanding of the importance of truth-telling, Treaties and First Nations justice

### How will the relationship between Common Threads and Australian Progress be described on the campaign website?

Common Threads is a First Nations led organisation, supported by the Centre for Australian Progress.

### About Common Threads

The Together for Treaty campaign is led by Common Threads: a new First Nations led organisation, working to harness the power of First Nations leadership, advocacy and change-making to win transformative change.

We are forging a new pathway to build Indigenous power and drive systemic change that centres the aspirations of our people - for Country, for community and for our rights.

Common Threads was co-founded by Dr Jackie Huggins AO (Bidjara / Birri Gubba Juru), Larissa Baldwin-Roberts (Widjabul Wia-bul / Bundjalung), and Amelia Telford (Bundjalung and South Sea Islander). Initially established as a program of the Centre for Australian Progress, in 2025 Common Threads is launching as an independent, First Nations led organisation.

### Privacy and Data Management

Common Threads is supported by the Centre for Australian Progress Ltd (ABN 76158172484) to build a strong community movement in support of Treaties and First Nations justice.

Donations to the Together for Treaty campaign are accepted by the Centre for Australian Progress. Donations over $2 are tax-deductible. By donating to this campaign, you agree that your contact details will be shared with the Centre for Australian Progress for the sole purpose of communicating with you regarding your donation (for example, providing your donation receipt via email).

### How will data be managed and what communication will donors receive?

**Common Threads to receive:**
- Donor names, contact details and donation amounts
- Any non-donation data from this website (e.g. petition signatures)

**Australian Progress to receive:**
- Donor names, contact details, address and donation amounts

### How will one-off donation income be reviewed and allocated?

Alex Hill to lead on a monthly review of Stripe income related to the campaign and providing a report to the AP leadership team and Claire to inform monthly reporting.

### How will the website and systems transition once Common Threads has established independent fundraising & financial processes?

The rationale for setting up a stand-alone Common Threads Stripe account is to make for an easier transition of website infrastructure and regular donor data once Common Threads can accept donations directly.
